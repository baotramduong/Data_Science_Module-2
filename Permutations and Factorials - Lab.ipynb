    "Let's return to factorials for a moment. In the last lesson, we talked about permutations in the context of a coverband creating a setlist. We wanted to know how many ways we could order 3 songs in their setlist. There were 3 possible ways of choosing a first song, 2 possible ways of choosing a second song, and only 1 way of choosing a third and final song, for $3 * 2 *1 = 6$ different ways in which the three different songs could be played. This number, 6, is equal to the factorial of 3, $3!$, the number of permutations of 3 distinct objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $3! = (3 * 2 * 1) = 6$. Notice that this is the same as writing $3 * 2! = 3 * (2 * 1)$ and $3 * 2 * 1! = 3 * 2 * (1)$. (By definition, the factorial of 1, $1!$, is equal to 1. The factorial of 0, $0!$ is also defined to be equal to 1.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generalize this to the case of computing the factorial of an integer n, $n!$. The factorial of n, $n!$, can be written as $n * (n-1)!$, which itself can be written as $n * (n-1) * (n-2)!$. That is, we can define the factorial of n in terms of the product of n by the factorial of (n-1), and so on and so forth, as seen in the equation below: \n",
